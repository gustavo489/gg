The AI engineer successfully initiated development by creating a React frontend with mock data for a sales website, following strict design guidelines and environment configurations. Initial iterations focused on building a fully functional frontend with cart and checkout features, which was validated through screenshots. User feedback led to iterative refinements, including content changes (removing location/phone, updating stock count) and replacing placeholder images with real product photos. Crucially, the product direction pivoted significantly from a traditional e-commerce flow to a direct WhatsApp-only sales model, requiring the removal of all cart and checkout functionalities. The AI engineer adapted by modifying relevant components to exclusively promote WhatsApp purchases.

The primary objective was to build a conversion-optimized landing page for an application, adhering to agency-quality design standards and incorporating specific UI/UX elements like glass-morphism, stylish accordions, and clear CTAs. The application is a sales website for cement. Initially, it was envisioned with a standard e-commerce flow (product display, add to cart, checkout). Key features developed include a hero section with limited-time offers and stock counters, product display cards with pricing and specifications, and customer testimonials. The product requirements evolved to remove location and phone number details, update product images to specific cimento Itau branding, and adjust stock indicators. Most significantly, the final iteration removed all e-commerce cart/checkout functionality, streamlining the process to a direct Buy via WhatsApp model, where clicking a button opens WhatsApp with pre-formatted order details to a specific contact number.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **FastAPI**: Python backend framework, though untouched in this trajectory.
- **MongoDB**: Database (configured but not utilized for real data in this trajectory).
- **Shadcn UI**: Pre-built, customizable React components used for building the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests (used for initial backend check).
- **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture is a standard full-stack setup, with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. However, the development trajectory primarily focused on the frontend, using mock data.

**Directory Structure:**


-   
    -   **Importance**: This file served as the central source for all frontend data, including product details, hero section content, and testimonials. It enabled rapid frontend development without backend integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated to reflect user requests, such as changing product images to cimento Itau, updating stock counts (43 sold of 200), and modifying WhatsApp purchase details. Initially contained data for cart/checkout, which was later removed.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Displays the site's navigation, including logo, offers, and previously the cart icon and phone number.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to remove the phone number and the cart icon. Simplified to only show the logo and Oferta por tempo limitado (Limited Time Offer).

-   
    -   **Importance**: The main display area, presenting the core product offer, stock information, and primary call-to-action.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to display the 157 sacos disponíveis (157 bags available) and Já vendidos: 43 (43 already sold) based on mock data. Later, its background image was updated to a real cimento Itau photo.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Renders individual product listings, showcasing product images, prices, and interaction buttons.
    -   **Changes Made**: Images were updated to real cimento Itau product photos. The Add to Cart button was replaced with a Comprar via WhatsApp (Buy via WhatsApp) button, and the associated cart logic was removed.

-   
    -   **Importance**: (Initially) Handled display of items in the shopping cart, quantity adjustments, and subtotal calculations.
    -   **Changes Made**: This component was rendered obsolete and effectively removed from the application flow when the user requested a WhatsApp only purchase model.

-   
    -   **Importance**: (Initially) Designed for handling user information during the checkout process.
    -   **Changes Made**: Similar to , this component was removed from the application flow due to the pivot to WhatsApp-only purchases.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Displays customer reviews or feedback.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to remove location information from the testimonials, as requested by the user.

-   
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for defining routes and overall application structure.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to reflect changes in component usage (e.g., removing imports and routes related to  and ) to align with the WhatsApp only purchasing model.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Intended to document API contracts for seamless frontend-backend integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created, but its content for backend integration was not fully utilized or implemented in this trajectory, as the focus remained on frontend modifications and the subsequent pivot.

-   
    -   **Importance**: The FastAPI backend application, containing API routes and MongoDB integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: No changes were made to this file during the entire trajectory, as backend development was not reached. It remains with its initial  and  endpoints.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development**: Implement MongoDB models and CRUD operations for actual product and order data.
-   **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with real data fetched from the FastAPI backend.
-   **Automated Testing**: Conduct comprehensive automated backend testing using  and automated frontend testing as per the  protocol.

<current_work>
The application is a sales landing page optimized for direct WhatsApp purchases, specifically for cimento Itau cement bags. The current state features a visually appealing React frontend designed according to modern UI/UX principles (slate/grey colors, responsive layout, subtle animations, no harsh gradients).

Key elements include:
*   **Hero Section**: Displays a product offer, current stock (e.g., 157 sacos disponíveis), and already sold count (e.g., 43 já vendidos), all integrated with real cimento Itau imagery.
*   **Product Display**: Shows two product packages with real images of cimento Itau cement bags, prices, and discounts.
*   **WhatsApp Integration**: The core functionality. All Add to Cart buttons and the shopping cart interface have been removed. Instead, there are prominent green Comprar via WhatsApp (Buy via WhatsApp) buttons on each product card and potentially in the cart/checkout area (which is now defunct).
*   **Streamlined Purchase Flow**: Clicking any Comprar via WhatsApp button directly opens WhatsApp with a pre-formatted message. This message includes comprehensive order details: product name, discounted price, percentage saved, quantity of bags, total weight, confirmation of free shipping, and a friendly closing. The message is directed to the WhatsApp number **6598206995**.
*   **Testimonials**: Customer testimonials are displayed, with location information removed as per user request.
*   **Header & Footer**: The header is clean, featuring only the logo and Oferta por tempo limitado, with the phone number and cart icon removed. A footer is also present.

The site is fully optimized for a quick conversion pathway: customer views product, clicks WhatsApp button, and immediately initiates a pre-filled chat for purchase.
